The aim is to provide a basic understanding of edge states, bulk topological invariants, and of the bulk--boundary correspondence with as simple mathematical tools as possible. We use noninteracting lattice models of topological insulators, building gradually on these to arrive from the simplest one-dimensional case (the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model for polyacetylene) to two-dimensional time-reversal invariant topological insulators (the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model for HgTe). In each case the model is introduced first and then its properties are discussed and subsequently generalized. The only prerequisite for the reader is a working knowledge in quantum mechanics, the relevant solid state physics background is provided as part of this self-contained text, which is complemented by end-of-chapter problems.},

We derive a correspondence between the physics of the device and the Hamiltonians of interest, and we simulate the physics of the device to observe a wide variety of physical phenomena, including chiral states in a Hall ladder, effective gauge potentials, and oscillations in high-dimensional lattices.

  abstract = {Topological insulators are a new class of materials that have attracted significant attention in contemporary condensed matter physics. They are different from regular insulators, and they display novel quantum properties that involve the idea of ‘topology’, an area of mathematics. Some of the fundamental concepts behind topological insulators, particularly in low-dimensional condensed matter systems such as poly-acetylene chains, can be understood using a simple one-dimensional toy model popularly known as the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. This model can also be used as an introduction to the topological insulators of higher dimensions. Here, we give a concise description of the SSH model along with a brief review of the background physics and attempt to understand the ideas of topological invariants, edge states, and bulk-boundary correspondence using the model.},

  abstract = {Motivated by recent experimental implementations of artificial gauge fields for gases of cold atoms, we study the scattering properties of particles that are subjected to time-periodic Hamiltonians. Making use of Floquet theory, we focus on translationally invariant situations in which the single-particle dynamics can be described in terms of spatially extended Floquet-Bloch waves. We develop a general formalism for the scattering of these Floquet-Bloch waves. An important role is played by the conservation of Floquet quasienergy, which is defined only up to the addition of integer multiples of ℏω for a Hamiltonian with period T=2π/ω. We discuss the consequences of this for the interpretation of “elastic” and “inelastic” scattering in cases of physical interest. We illustrate our general results with applications to the scattering of a single particle in a Floquet-Bloch state from a static potential and the scattering of two bosonic particles in Floquet-Bloch states through their interparticle interaction. We analyze examples of these scattering processes that are closely related to the schemes used to generate artificial gauge fields in cold-atom experiments, through optical dressing of internal states, or through time-periodic modulations of tight-binding lattices. We show that the effects of scattering cannot, in general, be understood by an effective time-independent Hamiltonian, even in the limit ω→∞ of rapid modulation. We discuss the relative sizes of the elastic scattering (required to stabilize many-body phases) and of the inelastic scattering (leading to deleterious heating effects). In particular, we describe how inelastic processes that can cause significant heating in the current experimental setup can be switched off by additional confinement of transverse motion.},

The examples are taken from applications in electron systems and transport theory. On the formal side, the book covers an introduction to second quantization, many-body Green's function, finite temperature Feynman diagrams and bosonization. The applications include traditional transport theory in bulk as well as mesoscopic systems, where both the Landau-Büttiker formalism and recent developments in correlated transport phenomena in mesoscopic systems and nano-structures are covered. Other topics include interacting electron gases, plasmons, electron-phonon interactions, superconductivity and a final chapter on one-dimensional systems where a detailed treatment of Luttinger liquid theory and bosonization techniques is given. Having grown out of a set of lecture notes, and containing many pedagogical exercises, this book is designed as a textbook for an advanced undergraduate or graduate course, and is also well suited for self-study.},

We express the photon-number moments of a Gaussian state in terms of the loop Hafnian, a function that when applied to \$(0,1)\$-matrices representing the adjacency of a graph, counts the number of its perfect matchings. We then use these expressions to calculate genuine photon-number correlations between modes in terms of cumulants. We show that when a uniformly lossy interferometer is fed in every input with identical single-mode Gaussian states with zero displacement, all the odd-order cumulants but the first one are zero. Finally, we employ the expressions we derive to study the distribution of cumulants up to the fourth order for different input states in a Gaussian boson sampling setup where \$K\$ identical states are fed into an \$\textbackslash ell\$-mode interferometer. We analyze the dependence of the cumulants as a function of the type of state, squeezed, lossy squeezed, squashed, or thermal, and as a function of the number of non-vacuum inputs. We find that thermal states perform much worse than other classical states, such as squashed states, at mimicking the photon-number cumulants of lossy or lossless squeezed states.},

  abstract = {Non-Abelian gauge fields give rise to nontrivial topological physics. Here we develop a scheme to create an arbitrary SU(2) lattice gauge field for photons in the synthetic frequency dimension using an array of dynamically modulated ring resonators. The photon polarization is taken as the spin basis to implement the matrix-valued gauge fields. Using a non-Abelian generalization of the Harper-Hofstadter Hamiltonian as a specific example, we show that the measurement of the steady-state photon amplitudes inside the resonators can reveal the band structures of the Hamiltonian, which show signatures of the underlying non-Abelian gauge field. These results provide opportunities to explore novel topological phenomena associated with non-Abelian lattice gauge fields in photonic systems.},

For these systems, the concept of band structure along the synthetic dimension plays a central role in their theoretical description. Here we provide a direct experimental measurement of the band structure along the synthetic dimension. By dynamically modulating a resonator at frequencies commensurate with its mode spacing, we create a periodically driven lattice of coupled modes in the frequency dimension. The strength and range of couplings can be dynamically reconfigured by changing the modulation amplitude and frequency. We show theoretically and demonstrate experimentally that time-resolved transmission measurements of this system provide a direct readout of its band structure. We also realize long-range coupling, gauge potentials and nonreciprocal bands by simply incorporating additional frequency drives, enabling great flexibility in band structure engineering.},

  abstract = {Conventional topological insulators support boundary states with dimension one lower than that of the bulk system that hosts them, and these states are topologically protected due to quantized bulk dipole moments. Recently, higherorder topological insulators have been proposed as a way of realizing topological states with dimensions two or more lower than that of the bulk due to the quantization of bulk quadrupole or octupole moments. However, all these proposals as well as experimental realizations have been restricted to real-space dimensions. Here, we construct photonic higher-order topological insulators (PHOTIs) in synthetic dimensions. We show the emergence of a quadrupole PHOTI supporting topologically protected corner modes in an array of modulated photonic molecules with a synthetic frequency dimension, where each photonic molecule comprises two coupled rings. By changing the phase difference of the modulation between adjacent coupled photonic molecules, we predict a dynamical topological phase transition in the PHOTI. Furthermore, we show that the concept of synthetic dimensions can be exploited to realize even higher-order multipole moments such as a fourth-order hexadecapole (16-pole) insulator supporting 0D corner modes in a 4D hypercubic synthetic lattice that cannot be realized in real-space lattices.},

We verify in an example that the Redfield equation preserves positivity after the slippage superoperator has been applied to the initial density matrix of the subsystem.

We build the classical Hamiltonian using Bloch coherent states and find its stationary points. They exhibit the presence of a ground-state quantum phase transition where a bifurcation occurs, showing a change in stability associated with an excited-state quantum phase transition. Symmetrically, for a sign change in one Hamiltonian parameter, the same phenomenon is observed in the highest-energy state. Employing the Holstein-Primakoff approximation, we derive analytic expressions for the quantum metric tensor and compute the scalar and Berry curvatures. We contrast the analytic results with their finite-size counterparts obtained through exact numerical diagonalization and find excellent agreement between them for large sizes of the system in a wide region of the parameter space except in points near the phase transition where the Holstein-Primakoff approximation ceases to be valid.},

  abstract = {When a physical system is subjected to a strong external multifrequency drive, its dynamics can be conveniently represented in the multidimensional Floquet lattice. The number of Floquet lattice dimensions equals the number of irrationally-related drive frequencies, and the evolution occurs in response to a built-in effective “electric” field, whose components are proportional to the corresponding drive frequencies. The mapping allows us to engineer and study temporal analogs of many real-space phenomena. Here, we focus on the specific example of a two-level system under a two-frequency drive that induces topologically nontrivial band structure in the 2D Floquet space. The observable consequence of such a construction is the quantized pumping of energy between the sources with frequencies ω1 and ω2. When the system is initialized into a Floquet band with the Chern number C, the pumping occurs at a rate P12=−P21=(C/2π)ℏω1ω2, an exact counterpart of the transverse current in a conventional topological insulator.},

  abstract = {We propose a generic protocol to experimentally measure the quantum metric tensor, a fundamental geometric property of quantum states. Our method is based on the observation that the excitation rate of a quantum state directly relates to components of the quantum metric upon applying a proper time-periodic modulation. We discuss the applicability of this scheme to generic two-level systems, where the Hamiltonian's parameters can be externally tuned, and also to the context of Bloch bands associated with lattice systems. As an illustration, we extract the quantum metric of the multiband Hofstadter model. Moreover, we demonstrate how this method can be used to directly probe the spread functional, a quantity which sets the lower bound on the spread of Wannier functions and signals phase transitions. Our proposal offers a universal probe for quantum geometry, which could be readily applied in a wide range of physical settings, ranging from superconducting quantum circuits to ultracold atomic gases.},

  abstract = {In the field of quantum simulation of condensed matter phenomena by artificially engineering the Hamiltonian of an atomic, molecular or optical system, the concept of synthetic dimensions has recently emerged as a powerful way to emulate phenomena such as topological phases of matter, which are now of great interest across many areas of physics. The main idea of a synthetic dimension is to couple together suitable degrees of freedom, such as a set of internal atomic states, in order to mimic the motion of a particle along an extra spatial dimension. This approach provides a way to engineer lattice Hamiltonians and enables the realization of higher-dimensional topological models in platforms with lower dimensionality. We give an overview of the recent progress in studying topological matter in synthetic dimensions. After reviewing proposals and realizations in various set-ups, we discuss future prospects in many-body physics, applications and topological effects in three or more spatial dimensions.},

After a review of the phases of matter amenable to an independent particle description, entangled phases of matter are described in an accessible and unified manner. The concepts of fractionalization and emergent gauge fields are introduced using the simplest resonating valence bond insulator with an energy gap, the Z2 spin liquid. Concepts in band topology and the parton method are then combined to obtain a large variety of experimentally relevant gapped states. Correlated metallic states are described, beginning with a discussion of the Kondo effect on magnetic impurities in metals. Metals without quasiparticle excitations are introduced using the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, followed by a discussion of critical Fermi surfaces and strange metals. Numerous end-of-chapter problems expand readers' comprehension and reinforce key concepts"--},

In this book, seventeen physicists and philosophers, all deeply concerned with understanding quantum mechanics, reply to Schlosshauer's penetrating questions about the central issues. They grant us an intimate look at their radically different ways of making sense of the theory's strangeness. What is quantum mechanics about? What is it telling us about nature? Can quantum information or new experiments help lift the fog? And where are we headed next? Everyone interested in the contemporary but often longstanding conundrums of quantum theory, whether lay reader or expert, will find much food for thought in these pages.

  abstract = {A set of coupled-mode equations is derived to describe mode propagation in uniform and slightly nonuniform cylindrical optical-fiber systems. The coupling between fibers of an array made up of n identical fibers each at the vertex of a polygon and one at the center, which is not necessarily the same as its n neighbors, is determined. Examples of this array are two fibers, three fibers in a row, and a hexagonal array with a fiber in the center. Very simple expressions for the coupling coefficients are presented. Mode coupling on a lossy fiber is investigated and a simple expression for the loss of a HE11 mode is given.},

  abstract = {In this work we study a one-dimensional lattice of Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick models with alternating couplings between nearest-neighbors sites, which resembles the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model. Typical properties of the underlying models are present in our semiclassical-topological hybrid system, allowing us to investigate an interplay between semiclassical bifurcations at mean-field level and topological phases. Our results show that bifurcations of the energy landscape lead to diverse ordered quantum phases. Furthermore, the study of the quantum fluctuations around the mean-field solution reveals the existence of nontrivial topological phases. These are characterized by the emergence of localized states at the edges of a chain with free open-boundary conditions.},

  abstract = {A Berry curvature is an imaginary component of the quantum geometric tensor (QGT) and is well studied in many branches of modern physics; however, the quantum metric as a real component of the QGT is less explored. Here, by using tunable superconducting circuits, we experimentally demonstrate two methods to directly measure the quantum metric tensor for characterizing the geometry and topology of underlying quantum states in parameter space. The first method is to probe the transition probability after a sudden quench, and the second one is to detect the excitation rate under weak periodic driving. Furthermore, based on quantum metric and Berry-curvature measurements, we explore a topological phase transition in a simulated time-reversal-symmetric system. The work opens up a unique approach to explore the topology of quantum states with the QGT.},

  abstract = {The physics of a photonic structure is commonly described in terms of its apparent geometric dimensionality. On the other hand, with the concept of synthetic dimension, it is in fact possible to explore physics in a space with a dimensionality that is higher as compared to the apparent geometrical dimensionality of the structures. In this review, we discuss the basic concepts of synthetic dimension in photonics, and highlight the various approaches toward demonstrating such synthetic dimensions for fundamental physics and potential applications.},

  abstract = {We show that a single ring resonator undergoing dynamic modulation can be used to create a synthetic space with an arbitrary dimension. In such a system, the phases of the modulation can be used to create a photonic gauge potential in high dimensions. As an illustration of the implication of this concept, we show that the Haldane model, which exhibits nontrivial topology in two dimensions, can be implemented in the synthetic space using three rings. Our results point to a route toward exploring higher-dimensional topological physics in low-dimensional physical structures. The dynamics of photons in such synthetic spaces also provides a mechanism to control the spectrum of light.},

  abstract = {We explore a single degenerate optical cavity supporting a synthetic two-dimensional space, which includes the frequency and the orbital angular momentum (OAM) axes of light. We create the effective gauge potential inside this synthetic space and show that the system exhibits topologically protected one-way edge states along the OAM axis at the boundaries of the frequency dimension. In this synthetic space, we present a robust generation and manipulation of entanglement between the frequency and OAM of photons. Our Letter shows that a higher-dimensional synthetic space involving multiple degrees of freedom of light can be achieved in a “zero-dimensional” spatial structure, pointing towards a unique platform to explore topological photonics and to realize potential applications in optical communications and quantum information processing.},
