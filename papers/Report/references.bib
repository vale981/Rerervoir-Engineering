The aim is to provide a basic understanding of edge states, bulk topological invariants, and of the bulk--boundary correspondence with as simple mathematical tools as possible. We use noninteracting lattice models of topological insulators, building gradually on these to arrive from the simplest one-dimensional case (the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model for polyacetylene) to two-dimensional time-reversal invariant topological insulators (the Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang model for HgTe). In each case the model is introduced first and then its properties are discussed and subsequently generalized. The only prerequisite for the reader is a working knowledge in quantum mechanics, the relevant solid state physics background is provided as part of this self-contained text, which is complemented by end-of-chapter problems.},

  abstract = {Topological insulators are a new class of materials that have attracted significant attention in contemporary condensed matter physics. They are different from regular insulators, and they display novel quantum properties that involve the idea of ‘topology’, an area of mathematics. Some of the fundamental concepts behind topological insulators, particularly in low-dimensional condensed matter systems such as poly-acetylene chains, can be understood using a simple one-dimensional toy model popularly known as the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. This model can also be used as an introduction to the topological insulators of higher dimensions. Here, we give a concise description of the SSH model along with a brief review of the background physics and attempt to understand the ideas of topological invariants, edge states, and bulk-boundary correspondence using the model.},

  abstract = {Motivated by recent experimental implementations of artificial gauge fields for gases of cold atoms, we study the scattering properties of particles that are subjected to time-periodic Hamiltonians. Making use of Floquet theory, we focus on translationally invariant situations in which the single-particle dynamics can be described in terms of spatially extended Floquet-Bloch waves. We develop a general formalism for the scattering of these Floquet-Bloch waves. An important role is played by the conservation of Floquet quasienergy, which is defined only up to the addition of integer multiples of ℏω for a Hamiltonian with period T=2π/ω. We discuss the consequences of this for the interpretation of “elastic” and “inelastic” scattering in cases of physical interest. We illustrate our general results with applications to the scattering of a single particle in a Floquet-Bloch state from a static potential and the scattering of two bosonic particles in Floquet-Bloch states through their interparticle interaction. We analyze examples of these scattering processes that are closely related to the schemes used to generate artificial gauge fields in cold-atom experiments, through optical dressing of internal states, or through time-periodic modulations of tight-binding lattices. We show that the effects of scattering cannot, in general, be understood by an effective time-independent Hamiltonian, even in the limit ω→∞ of rapid modulation. We discuss the relative sizes of the elastic scattering (required to stabilize many-body phases) and of the inelastic scattering (leading to deleterious heating effects). In particular, we describe how inelastic processes that can cause significant heating in the current experimental setup can be switched off by additional confinement of transverse motion.},

We use a single nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond to experimentally study a synthetic quantum Hall effect with a two-tone drive. We measure the evolution of trajectories of two quantum states, initially prepared at nearby points in synthetic phase space. We detect the synthetic Hall effect through the predicted overlap oscillations at a quantized fundamental frequency proportional to the Chern number, which characterizes the topological phases of the system. We further observe half-quantization of the Chern number at the transition between the synthetic Hall regime and the trivial regime, and the associated concentration of local Berry curvature in synthetic phase space. Our Letter opens up the possibility of using driven qubits to design and study higher-dimensional topological insulators and semimetals in synthetic dimensions.},

The basic idea of the book is to provide a self-contained formulation of the theoretical framework without losing mathematical rigor, while at the same time providing physical motivation and examples. The examples are taken from applications in electron systems and transport theory. On the formal side, the book covers an introduction to second quantization, many-body Green's function, finite temperature Feynman diagrams and bosonization. The applications include traditional transport theory in bulk as well as mesoscopic systems, where both the Landau-Büttiker formalism and recent developments in correlated transport phenomena in mesoscopic systems and nano-structures are covered. Other topics include interacting electron gases, plasmons, electron-phonon interactions, superconductivity and a final chapter on one-dimensional systems where a detailed treatment of Luttinger liquid theory and bosonization techniques is given. Having grown out of a set of lecture notes, and containing many pedagogical exercises, this book is designed as a textbook for an advanced undergraduate or graduate course, and is also well suited for self-study.},

  abstract = {Topological insulators are fascinating states of matter exhibiting protected edge states and robust quantized features in their bulk. Here we propose and validate experimentally a method to detect topological properties in the bulk of one-dimensional chiral systems. We first introduce the mean chiral displacement, an observable that rapidly approaches a value proportional to the Zak phase during the free evolution of the system. Then we measure the Zak phase in a photonic quantum walk of twisted photons, by observing the mean chiral displacement in its bulk. Next, we measure the Zak phase in an alternative, inequivalent timeframe and combine the two windings to characterize the full phase diagram of this Floquet system. Finally, we prove the robustness of the measure by introducing dynamical disorder in the system. This detection method is extremely general and readily applicable to all present one-dimensional platforms simulating static or Floquet chiral systems.},

  abstract = {We develop a closed-form expression for the moments and cumulants of Gaussian states when measured in the photon-number basis. We express the photon-number moments of a Gaussian state in terms of the loop Hafnian, a function that when applied to \$(0,1)\$-matrices representing the adjacency of a graph, counts the number of its perfect matchings. We then use these expressions to calculate genuine photon-number correlations between modes in terms of cumulants. We show that when a uniformly lossy interferometer is fed in every input with identical single-mode Gaussian states with zero displacement, all the odd-order cumulants but the first one are zero. Finally, we employ the expressions we derive to study the distribution of cumulants up to the fourth order for different input states in a Gaussian boson sampling setup where \$K\$ identical states are fed into an \$\textbackslash ell\$-mode interferometer. We analyze the dependence of the cumulants as a function of the type of state, squeezed, lossy squeezed, squashed, or thermal, and as a function of the number of non-vacuum inputs. We find that thermal states perform much worse than other classical states, such as squashed states, at mimicking the photon-number cumulants of lossy or lossless squeezed states.},

Thanks to a resource-saving and flexible fiber-loop architecture, we realize inhomogeneous two-dimensional quantum walks up to 25 steps, over an effective 51×51 lattice with tunable local parameters. Spin-polarized chiral edge states are observed at the boundary of two distinct quantum walk domains.

  abstract = {Topological materials have become the focus of intense research in recent years, since they exhibit fundamentally new physical phenomena with potential applications for novel devices and quantum information technology. One of the hallmarks of topological materials is the existence of protected gapless surface states, which arise due to a nontrivial topology of the bulk wave functions. This review provides a pedagogical introduction into the field of topological quantum matter with an emphasis on classification schemes. Both fully gapped and gapless topological materials and their classification in terms of nonspatial symmetries, such as time reversal, as well as spatial symmetries, such as reflection, are considered. Furthermore, the classification of gapless modes localized on topological defects is surveyed. The classification of these systems is discussed by use of homotopy groups, Clifford algebras, K theory, and nonlinear sigma models describing the Anderson (de)localization at the surface or inside a defect of the material. Theoretical model systems and their topological invariants are reviewed together with recent experimental results in order to provide a unified and comprehensive perspective of the field. While the bulk of this article is concerned with the topological properties of noninteracting or mean-field Hamiltonians, a brief overview of recent results and open questions concerning the topological classifications of interacting systems is also provided.},

For these systems, the concept of band structure along the synthetic dimension plays a central role in their theoretical description. Here we provide a direct experimental measurement of the band structure along the synthetic dimension. By dynamically modulating a resonator at frequencies commensurate with its mode spacing, we create a periodically driven lattice of coupled modes in the frequency dimension. The strength and range of couplings can be dynamically reconfigured by changing the modulation amplitude and frequency. We show theoretically and demonstrate experimentally that time-resolved transmission measurements of this system provide a direct readout of its band structure. We also realize long-range coupling, gauge potentials and nonreciprocal bands by simply incorporating additional frequency drives, enabling great flexibility in band structure engineering.},

  abstract = {Conventional topological insulators support boundary states with dimension one lower than that of the bulk system that hosts them, and these states are topologically protected due to quantized bulk dipole moments. Recently, higherorder topological insulators have been proposed as a way of realizing topological states with dimensions two or more lower than that of the bulk due to the quantization of bulk quadrupole or octupole moments. However, all these proposals as well as experimental realizations have been restricted to real-space dimensions. Here, we construct photonic higher-order topological insulators (PHOTIs) in synthetic dimensions. We show the emergence of a quadrupole PHOTI supporting topologically protected corner modes in an array of modulated photonic molecules with a synthetic frequency dimension, where each photonic molecule comprises two coupled rings. By changing the phase difference of the modulation between adjacent coupled photonic molecules, we predict a dynamical topological phase transition in the PHOTI. Furthermore, we show that the concept of synthetic dimensions can be exploited to realize even higher-order multipole moments such as a fourth-order hexadecapole (16-pole) insulator supporting 0D corner modes in a 4D hypercubic synthetic lattice that cannot be realized in real-space lattices.},

  abstract = {For a slow open quantum subsystem weakly coupled to a fast thermal bath, we derive the general form of the slippage to be applied to the initial conditions of the Redfield master equation. This slippage is given by a superoperator which describes the non-Markovian dynamics of the subsystem during the short-time relaxation of the thermal bath. We verify in an example that the Redfield equation preserves positivity after the slippage superoperator has been applied to the initial density matrix of the subsystem. For δ-correlated baths, the Redfield master equation reduces to the Lindblad master equation and the slippage of initial conditions vanishes consistently.},

We build the classical Hamiltonian using Bloch coherent states and find its stationary points. They exhibit the presence of a ground-state quantum phase transition where a bifurcation occurs, showing a change in stability associated with an excited-state quantum phase transition. Symmetrically, for a sign change in one Hamiltonian parameter, the same phenomenon is observed in the highest-energy state. Employing the Holstein-Primakoff approximation, we derive analytic expressions for the quantum metric tensor and compute the scalar and Berry curvatures. We contrast the analytic results with their finite-size counterparts obtained through exact numerical diagonalization and find excellent agreement between them for large sizes of the system in a wide region of the parameter space except in points near the phase transition where the Holstein-Primakoff approximation ceases to be valid.},

While in the HOPS case the correct description of the bath correlation function (BCF) in the time domain is decisive, it turns out that a windowed Fourier transform of the BCF is an appropriate indicator of the quality of the discretization in the multi-Davydov-Ansatz. For the spin-boson model with sub-Ohmic spectral density considered here, a discretization of the spectral density based on an exponential distribution, used previously, turns out to be most favorable.},

Numerical algorithms approximate intractable quantities from computable ones. They estimate integrals from evaluations of the integrand, or the path of a dynamical system described by differential equations from evaluations of the vector field. In other words, they infer a latent quantity from data. This book shows that it is thus formally possible to think of computational routines as learning machines, and to use the notion of Bayesian inference to build more flexible, efficient, or customised algorithms for computation. The text caters for Masters' and PhD students, as well as postgraduate researchers in artificial intelligence, computer science, statistics, and applied mathematics. Extensive background material is provided along with a wealth of figures, worked examples, and exercises (with solutions) to develop intuition.},

  abstract = {The quantum walk was originally proposed as a quantum-mechanical analog of the classical random walk, and has since become a powerful tool in quantum information science. In this paper, we show that discrete-time quantum walks provide a versatile platform for studying topological phases, which are currently the subject of intense theoretical and experimental investigations. In particular, we demonstrate that recent experimental realizations of quantum walks with cold atoms, photons, and ions simulate a nontrivial one-dimensional topological phase. With simple modifications, the quantum walk can be engineered to realize all of the topological phases, which have been classified in one and two dimensions. We further discuss the existence of robust edge modes at phase boundaries, which provide experimental signatures for the nontrivial topological character of the system.},

  abstract = {Modern deep learning has enabled unprecedented achievements in various domains. Nonetheless, employment of machine learning for wave function representations is focused on more traditional architectures such as restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs) and fully connected neural networks. In this Letter, we establish that contemporary deep learning architectures, in the form of deep convolutional and recurrent networks, can efficiently represent highly entangled quantum systems. By constructing tensor network equivalents of these architectures, we identify an inherent reuse of information in the network operation as a key trait which distinguishes them from standard tensor network-based representations, and which enhances their entanglement capacity. Our results show that such architectures can support volume-law entanglement scaling, polynomially more efficiently than presently employed RBMs. Thus, beyond a quantification of the entanglement capacity of leading deep learning architectures, our analysis formally motivates a shift of trending neural-network-based wave function representations closer to the state-of-the-art in machine learning.},

  abstract = {Topological phases enable protected transport along the edges of materials, offering immunity against scattering from disorder and imperfections. These phases have been demonstrated for electronic systems, electromagnetic waves1–5, cold atoms6,7, acoustics8 and even mechanics9, and their potential applications include spintronics, quantum computing and highly efficient lasers10–12. Typically, the model describing topological insulators is a spatial lattice in two or three dimensions. However, topological edge states have~also been observed in a lattice with one spatial dimension and one synthetic dimension (corresponding to the spin modes of an ultracold atom13–15), and atomic modes have been used as synthetic dimensions to demonstrate lattice models and physical phenomena that are not accessible to experiments in spatial lattices13,16,17. In photonics, topological lattices with synthetic dimensions have been proposed for the study of physical phenomena in high dimensions and interacting photons18–22, but so far photonic topological insulators in synthetic dimensions have not been observed. Here we demonstrate experimentally a photonic topological insulator in synthetic dimensions. We fabricate a photonic lattice in which photons are subjected to an effective magnetic field in a space with one spatial dimension and one synthetic modal dimension. Our scheme supports topological edge states in this spatial-modal lattice, resulting in a robust topological state that extends over the bulk of a two-dimensional real-space lattice. Our system can be used to increase the dimensionality of a photonic lattice and induce long-range coupling by design, leading to lattice models that can be used to study unexplored physical phenomena.},

We show that the proposed detection converges rapidly and it can be implemented in a wide class of chiral systems. Furthermore, it can measure arbitrary winding numbers and topological boundaries, it applies to all non-interacting systems, independently of their quantum statistics, and it requires no additional elements, such as external fields, nor filled bands.},

The number of Floquet lattice dimensions equals the number of irrationally-related drive frequencies, and the evolution occurs in response to a built-in effective “electric” field, whose components are proportional to the corresponding drive frequencies. The mapping allows us to engineer and study temporal analogs of many real-space phenomena. Here, we focus on the specific example of a two-level system under a two-frequency drive that induces topologically nontrivial band structure in the 2D Floquet space. The observable consequence of such a construction is the quantized pumping of energy between the sources with frequencies ω1 and ω2. When the system is initialized into a Floquet band with the Chern number C, the pumping occurs at a rate P12=−P21=(C/2π)ℏω1ω2, an exact counterpart of the transverse current in a conventional topological insulator.},

Moreover, tensor network states have turned out to play a key role in other scientific disciplines. In this context, here I provide an overview of the basic concepts and key developments in the field. I briefly discuss the most important tensor network structures and algorithms, together with an outline of advances related to global and gauge symmetries, fermions, topological order, classification of phases, entanglement Hamiltonians, holografic duality, artificial intelligence, the 2D Hubbard model, 2D quantum antiferromagnets, conformal field theory, quantum chemistry, disordered systems and many-body localization.},

  abstract = {We propose a generic protocol to experimentally measure the quantum metric tensor, a fundamental geometric property of quantum states. Our method is based on the observation that the excitation rate of a quantum state directly relates to components of the quantum metric upon applying a proper time-periodic modulation. We discuss the applicability of this scheme to generic two-level systems, where the Hamiltonian's parameters can be externally tuned, and also to the context of Bloch bands associated with lattice systems. As an illustration, we extract the quantum metric of the multiband Hofstadter model. Moreover, we demonstrate how this method can be used to directly probe the spread functional, a quantity which sets the lower bound on the spread of Wannier functions and signals phase transitions. Our proposal offers a universal probe for quantum geometry, which could be readily applied in a wide range of physical settings, ranging from superconducting quantum circuits to ultracold atomic gases.},

  abstract = {In the field of quantum simulation of condensed matter phenomena by artificially engineering the Hamiltonian of an atomic, molecular or optical system, the concept of synthetic dimensions has recently emerged as a powerful way to emulate phenomena such as topological phases of matter, which are now of great interest across many areas of physics. The main idea of a synthetic dimension is to couple together suitable degrees of freedom, such as a set of internal atomic states, in order to mimic the motion of a particle along an extra spatial dimension. This approach provides a way to engineer lattice Hamiltonians and enables the realization of higher-dimensional topological models in platforms with lower dimensionality. We give an overview of the recent progress in studying topological matter in synthetic dimensions. After reviewing proposals and realizations in various set-ups, we discuss future prospects in many-body physics, applications and topological effects in three or more spatial dimensions.},

  abstract = {"This completely revised and updated graduate-level textbook is an ideal introduction to gauge theories and their applications to high-energy particle physics, and takes an in-depth look at two new laws of nature--quantum chromodynamics and the electroweak theory. From quantum electrodynamics through unified theories of the interactions among leptons and quarks, Chris Quigg examines the logic and structure behind gauge theories and the experimental underpinnings of today's theories. Quigg emphasizes how we know what we know, and in the era of the Large Hadron Collider, his insightful survey of the standard model and the next great questions for particle physics makes for compelling reading.The brand-new edition shows how the electroweak theory developed in conversation with experiment. Featuring a wide-ranging treatment of electroweak symmetry breaking, the physics of the Higgs boson, and the importance of the 1-TeV scale, the book moves beyond established knowledge and investigates the path toward unified theories of strong, weak, and electromagnetic interactions. Explicit calculations and diverse exercises allow readers to derive the consequences of these theories. Extensive annotated bibliographies accompany each chapter, amplify points of conceptual or technical interest, introduce further applications, and lead readers to the research literature. Students and seasoned practitioners will profit from the text's current insights, and specialists wishing to understand gauge theories will find the book an ideal reference for self-study.

After a review of the phases of matter amenable to an independent particle description, entangled phases of matter are described in an accessible and unified manner. The concepts of fractionalization and emergent gauge fields are introduced using the simplest resonating valence bond insulator with an energy gap, the Z2 spin liquid. Concepts in band topology and the parton method are then combined to obtain a large variety of experimentally relevant gapped states. Correlated metallic states are described, beginning with a discussion of the Kondo effect on magnetic impurities in metals. Metals without quasiparticle excitations are introduced using the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model, followed by a discussion of critical Fermi surfaces and strange metals. Numerous end-of-chapter problems expand readers' comprehension and reinforce key concepts"--},

Our approach builds on two main ingredients: (1) a constriction optical potential, which generates a mesoscopic channel connected to two reservoirs, and (2) a time-periodic modulation of the channel specifically designed to generate motion along an additional synthetic dimension. This fictitious dimension is spanned by the harmonic oscillator modes associated with the tightly confined channel, and hence, the corresponding “lattice sites” are intimately related to the energy of the system. We analyze the quantum-transport properties of this hybrid two-dimensional system, highlighting the appealing features offered by the synthetic dimension. In particular, we demonstrate how the energetic nature of the synthetic dimension combined with the quasienergy spectrum of the periodically driven channel allows for the direct and unambiguous observation of the quantized Hall effect in a two-reservoir geometry. Our work illustrates how topological properties of matter can be accessed in a minimal one-dimensional setup, with direct and practical experimental consequences.},

Examples of this array are two fibers, three fibers in a row, and a hexagonal array with a fiber in the center. Very simple expressions for the coupling coefficients are presented. Mode coupling on a lossy fiber is investigated and a simple expression for the loss of a HE11 mode is given.},

Typical properties of the underlying models are present in our semiclassical-topological hybrid system, allowing us to investigate an interplay between semiclassical bifurcations at mean-field level and topological phases. Our results show that bifurcations of the energy landscape lead to diverse ordered quantum phases. Furthermore, the study of the quantum fluctuations around the mean-field solution reveals the existence of nontrivial topological phases. These are characterized by the emergence of localized states at the edges of a chain with free open-boundary conditions.},

Here, by using tunable superconducting circuits, we experimentally demonstrate two methods to directly measure the quantum metric tensor for characterizing the geometry and topology of underlying quantum states in parameter space. The first method is to probe the transition probability after a sudden quench, and the second one is to detect the excitation rate under weak periodic driving. Furthermore, based on quantum metric and Berry-curvature measurements, we explore a topological phase transition in a simulated time-reversal-symmetric system. The work opens up a unique approach to explore the topology of quantum states with the QGT.},

Although the theoretical footing is still under development, we argue that quasi-periodically driven quantum systems can be treated with generalisations of Floquet theory in suitable parameter regimes. Moreover, we provide a generalisation of the Floquet-Magnus expansion and argue that quasi-periodic driving offers a promising route for quantum simulations.},

In this review, we discuss the basic concepts of synthetic dimension in photonics, and highlight the various approaches toward demonstrating such synthetic dimensions for fundamental physics and potential applications.},

In such a system, the phases of the modulation can be used to create a photonic gauge potential in high dimensions. As an illustration of the implication of this concept, we show that the Haldane model, which exhibits nontrivial topology in two dimensions, can be implemented in the synthetic space using three rings. Our results point to a route toward exploring higher-dimensional topological physics in low-dimensional physical structures. The dynamics of photons in such synthetic spaces also provides a mechanism to control the spectrum of light.},

We create the effective gauge potential inside this synthetic space and show that the system exhibits topologically protected one-way edge states along the OAM axis at the boundaries of the frequency dimension. In this synthetic space, we present a robust generation and manipulation of entanglement between the frequency and OAM of photons. Our Letter shows that a higher-dimensional synthetic space involving multiple degrees of freedom of light can be achieved in a “zero-dimensional” spatial structure, pointing towards a unique platform to explore topological photonics and to realize potential applications in optical communications and quantum information processing.},
